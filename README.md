# Introduction to Deep Learning

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for an introductory lecture on machine learning and deep learning using Python, Scikit-learn, and Keras. I discussed the following topics:

1. Linear regression
2. Classification
3. Multilayer perceptrons (simple neural networks)
4. Convolutional neural networks
5. Transfer learning with a pre-trained model
